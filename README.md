Ahead are instructions to get this Workflow running inside your game's repo, written **as if it's your first time using Actions.** Skip ahead if you know what you're doing.

‚úâÔ∏è If something doesn't work, there's an FAQ below. If I messed something up, **send a pull request and I'll sort it out.** Thanks!

## **Instructions**
### **üßë‚Äçüç≥ Before proceeding:**
- I'm assuming you're using GitHub for your version control (otherwise, you wouldn't be here anyways üòÖ).
- I'm assuming you're using **Godot 4.3-stable downloaded from the website.**
  - This may not work on Steam or itch.io versions of the engine. Don't quote me on that.

### üì¶ Set-up
You might want to check the üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ below before starting. It has valuable information and context you might want to know.

#### üíª Installation
**Creating your itch.io game page.**
- Create a new game just like any other.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your visibility and access is set to either **Draft** (if you're working alone) or **Restricted** (if you're working with a team, so people you choose can access the game page).
- Write down your username. It's the text behind the `.itch.io` link that goes to your profile page.
  - In my case, it's `framebuffers`.

---

**Getting an itch.io API key.**
- Get your [itch.io API key](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys) here. 
  - You'll go to a page like this one. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee5d61c-bdd2-477a-8bab-e6c272b2cbb3)
  - Click on **Generate new API key.**
- You'll get a message saying **API key created**. Below that, You'll have a table with your API key, Source and Creation date.
  - Click on **View** and copy that string. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/508fd5e0-8c4f-4537-8906-89ea761a3c17)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't share this key! It gives you to control over your account through the API.
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to revoke it, click on **Revoke.**

---

‚ÑπÔ∏è Before proceeding, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ Your itch.io username.
- ‚úÖ Your game name.
- ‚úÖ Your itch.io API key.

---

**Creating the secrets**
- Inside the GitHub page of your game, click on Settings. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd1bd72-76a4-4d8d-aff4-c0a9adb92110)
- On the left panel, inside the Security section, click **Secrets and variables** and then **Actions.** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73bc70b4-51fd-456c-8244-b5f62f0403f5)
- Click on **New repository secret.**
- Create three secrets:
  - `ITCHAPI`: your itch.io API key,
  - `USERNAME`: your itch.io username,
  - `GAMENAME`: your game name.
- You should have something like this: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cb2ed63-da20-4261-9a81-970778771f09)
  - üéâ Now you're ready to deploy!

---

**Preparing your project folder**
- Create a folder called `.github` inside the root of your project. Inside that new folder, create another folder called `workflows`.
- Place `main.yaml` inside `workflows`.
- Create a commit to the repository you chose to run the Action on. By default, the Workflow is configured to look for a `main` branch.
- Push it to GitHub!

---

## üì§ Deployment
Your game will go through a `Workflow`. What this does, is create a container with everything needed to compile your game, package it into a ZIP file and upload it to itch.io
Every single time you commit to the chosen branch, a **workflow will run over your committed codebase.**
The first time **may take a while**, up to 10 minutes in some cases, because GitHub must get all the necessary files from scratch.
**Later runs will be much faster (down to 2 minutes or so).**
Commits **outside** the monitored branch will **skip** the check:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7255db7-3d26-4546-84e0-83c3bebd0246)

Inside each run, you'll find the details of each step taken to get your build up and running. If you add or delete any steps, you'll see them reflected here.

If all goes well, there should be a game ready to play!

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ:
- **My game doesn't appear on itch/it shows an older build!**
  - Make sure this item is checked inside your game's Dashboard (where you can change the name and such) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67fbbd69-ab5f-48da-93a9-dc5197bdf947)
- **What are 'secrets'?**
  - This one was confusing to me at first, but let me explain: 
    - At the end of `main.yaml`, you'll see these weird strings: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/687773b7-d0e1-4c25-9524-2d9a07ce369e)
      - These are environment variables that have sensitive data, like API keys, needed to run this Workflow. These variables will be defined on the _Actions secrets and variables_ window.
      - `secrets.ITCHAPI` means that it'll look for the variable named `ITCHAPI` inside the `secrets` tab above the keys.
- **My workflow is failing in the middle!**
  - There are several reasons why:
    - Make sure you have **every single asset** you need to compile your game inside the the project folder.
      - If your game is large, use this Workflow at your own discretion.
    - You may need to compile an initial web build before proceeding.
      - This step is done so you generate a `export_presets.cfg` file.
      - ‚ÑπÔ∏è What I did, is compiling inside a folder called `bin`, and then adding it to my `.gitignore`.
    - Check your `.gitignore` before proceeding.
      - You don't want any large binaries or personal data inside your GitHub repo, even if it's private.
    - You may have issues with your game name.
      - ‚ö†Ô∏è If, by chance, uses any spaces or special characters, you'll need to write them down **inside single quote marks (`'`).**
      - ‚ÑπÔ∏è This depends a lot on a case-by-case basis, but if you have problems with this later, just hardcode the name of your game on the YAML file. You can do the same with the game name... **just don't do it with the API key.**
- **Why do I need to create the itch.io page if I haven't finished my game?**
  - You need to if you're running this anyway, but I **don't recommend deploying _that_ often.**
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è For game jams (and other cases) it is good practice to have your itch.io page ready to go. It's time consuming, and you **don't want to do this at the last minute, especially under pressure.**
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è I'd recommend you create a separate branch to work on smaller changes instead of working on your main branch only. This way, you don't trigger this action _every time you commit._
- **What does "billable time" mean? Are they gonna charge me money for this?**
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be65625-7473-41bd-b5b2-3895e2fd5d66)
  - This also caught me off-guard. Turns out that each account has an allowance to run these Actions.
  - [Click here for more information about this that I found.](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/ci-cd/github-actions/usage-limits.html)
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è **TL;DR: don't worry, it should be free.** It'll error out if your Workflow is too spicy and you need to pay for it.
